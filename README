FARMIN
======

This is a crude telemetry display for indoor cycling, specifically on a
trainer or rollers. There are two components: a Python desktop software
component using ncurses and pyserial to parse and display, and an Arduino
sketch for providing numbers of pings every two seconds.

This code was developed on a whim and as a result is usable but
buggy. There could be some code refactoring to become a package or
something but that's for a later time. As-is, you use this at your
own risk.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------
There is no configuration besides assembling the hardware (Arduino)
portion with a hall effect sensor.

Developed and tested with Python 3.6 and the PySerial library at the
time of Python 3.6's release.
